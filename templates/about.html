            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Real Vinum was founded on a simple passion: bringing exceptional, authentic wines from Spain and Italy to American tables. What began as a personal journey through the sunbaked vineyards of Spain and the rolling hills of Italy has evolved into a boutique importing business dedicated to sharing these discoveries.</p>
            
            <p>As a small, family-operated business, we personally select each wine in our portfolio, working directly with wineries that share our values of quality, authenticity, and tradition. Every bottle tells a story of the land, the people, and generations of winemaking heritage.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
            <p>At Real Vinum, we believe in building relationships, not just conducting transactions. We partner with restaurants and retailers who appreciate the story behind each bottle and can communicate that passion to their customers.</p>
            
            <p>By keeping our operation small and focused, we maintain close relationships with both our suppliers and clients, ensuring consistent quality and personalized service that large distributors simply cannot match.</p>
